## Getting Started

Throughout these examples we will assume you've already gone through the process of installing [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu) or [ROS2](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Foxy/) and have a [ROS websocket server](https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite) running and available to connect with.

The first step in connecting ROS with a website will always be establishing a connection. With `react-ros`, we make this easy by providing a very simple and easy-to-use context provider called `useROS` to get you started.

## Connect to ROS

Here is an example of how you can use the `useROS` component and connect your website to your robot!  In this example we provide a `ToggleConnect` component that uses the `useROS` context provider to quickly and easily integrate ROS into any button or status indicator you could want to use.

```javascript
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import { useROS } from '../ROS'

function ToggleConnect() {
  const { isConnected, topics, url, changeUrl, toggleConnection, toggleAutoconnect} = useROS();

  // Try replacing this with your own unique rosbridge webserver address
  const defaultURL = "ws://0.0.0.0:9090";
	
  // only runs once when ToggleConnect is first rendered (mounted)
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('ToggleConnect is mounted!');
    if (url !== defaultURL) {
      changeUrl(defaultURL);
    }

    // use autoconnect if you want to automatically connect to your ROS websocket when this component mounts!
    if (!isConnected) {
      toggleAutoconnect();
    }
  },[])
    
  // runs every time there is an update to any state/rerender
  useEffect(() => {
    //console.log('rerender ToggleConnect');
    if (urlInput !== url) {
      changeUrl(urlInput);
    }
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>Simple connect:  </b><button onClick={ toggleConnection }>Toggle Connect</button>  <br />
        <b>ROS url input:  </b><input name="urlInput" defaultValue={ url } onChange={event => changeUrl(event.target.value)} />  <br />
        <b>ROS url to connect to:  </b> {url}  <br />
        <b>Status of ROS:</b> { isConnected ? "connected" : "not connected" }   <br />
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ToggleConnect;
```

## ToggleConnect in use
To use the simple `ToggleConnect` component we made above, wrap it in the provided `ROS` context provider component from `react-ros` and everything should just work. Go ahead and try it live below on your robot!

import { Playground } from 'docz'
import { ROS } from '../ROS'

import ToggleConnect from './ToggleConnect'
import EchoTopic from './EchoTopic'

<Playground>
  <ROS>
    <ToggleConnect />
  </ROS>
